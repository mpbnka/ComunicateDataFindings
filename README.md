# Ford GoBike Analysis
Udacity DataAnalysis Project 5

## DataSet

    Dataset: Ford GoBike
    Time: January 2019 to December 2019
    The dataset consists of information collected for every month between January 2019 to December 2019 and consolidated into a master csv file.
    Data consisted user types, lattitudes and logitudes of location of start and end of a trip which helped in finding the distance travelled between places for each trip. Trip start and endtime helped to get the trip time.


## Summary of Findings

This project is a win - win situation where a large number of people can benefit from this program:

    Environmentally friendly, budget friendly, and lifetsyle friendly.
    Subscribers (i.e. daily commuters) benefit from a health commuting choice.
    Customers (i.e. tourists, students, etc.) have a sustainable, yet flexible option for touring the city.
    Affordable and convenient transportation for the people of all socioeconomic classes.
    Renting a bike from theFord GoBike System is a fantastic (healthy and environmentally friendly) way of moving around in the city, both for enjoyment and work.

## Key Insights on Findings
There are two types of clients using the system: Subscribers and Customers. Subscribers are primarily daily commuters, having short trips to and from work, who rent a bike on weekdays at 8-9am and 5-6pm. Customers are usually tourists or occassional riders who use the system mainly on weekends to explore the Bay Area.
